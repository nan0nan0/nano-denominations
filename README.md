# Nano currency denominations and their symbols

A List of the Nanocurrency Denomninations with symbols that are either commonly used or proposed. This is *not* an official list and is open to comment and discussion. Please raise an issue if you feel this information is incorrect and wish to amend it.

## Unit Naming

**The Exchange Pair of Nano currency known as XRB/NANO is equal to 1 Mnano or 1,000,000 nano.** 

Because the Nano currency is highly dvisible, it is useful to familiraise yourself with the units and denominaitons, especially if you are developing in Nano. There is a slight public confusion over the naming system in Nano, as the public are familiar with the Exchange Pair Unit (XRB/NANO) as the 'nano' unit of Nanocurrency and not the proper 10<sup>27</sup> of raw that constitutes one nano unit.

## Smallest and Largest Units of Nano currency

Nano's smallest unit is 1 raw. The largest unit is 1Gnano. 

| 1 raw | | | | | | 1 unano | 1mnano | 1knano | 1 nano | 1 Mnano | 1 Gnano | 
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10<sup>0</sup> | 10<sup>3</sup> | 10<sup>6</sup>  | 10<sup>9</sup>  | 10<sup>12</sup> | 10<sup>15</sup> | 10<sup>18</sup> | 10<sup>21</sup>  | 10<sup>24</sup>  | 10<sup>27</sup> | 10<sup>30</sup>  | 10<sup>33</sup>  |



1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 raw (1033) = 1 Gnano

1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 raw (1030) = 1 Mnano = 1 XRB/NANO (exchange pair)

1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 raw (1027) = 1 knano

1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 raw (1024) = 1 nano

1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 raw (1021) = 1 mnano

1,000,000,000,000,000,000 raw (1018) = 1 μnano

1,000,000,000,000,000 raw (1015)

1,000,000,000,000 raw (1012)

1,000,000,000 raw (109)

1,000,000 raw (106)

1,000 raw (103)

1 raw


## Nano Denomination History

Initially Nano Currency was called Raiblocks. The initial mint of and subsequent burn of Nano currency resulted in a distribution 133,248,297 individual raiblocks. 

### Nano Superunits	

1000	Gnano

### Nano Subunits	

| Unit Symbol | Unit Name  | Unit Description  | Unit decimal amount  | Unit Expression |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 kn | knano | One thousandth of a Nano  | 0.001  |  1 ⁄ 1,000 |
| 1 n | nano | One millionth of a Nano  | 0.0000001  |  1 ⁄ 1,000,000 |
| 1 mn | mnano | One billionth of a Nano  | 0.0000000001  |  1 ⁄ 10<sup>9</sup>	|
| 1 μn | μnano | One trillionth of a Nano  | 0.0000000000001  | 1 ⁄ 10<sup>12</sup>	|
| 1 raw | raw | One nonillionth of a Nano  | 0.0000000000000000000000000000001  |  1 ⁄ 10<sup>30</sup>	|

### Ideas for Nano Symbols

It has been mentioned that in absence of a true Nano unicode charater, another symbol could be used as a sign to denote Nano. Here are a few signs that are available and may be suitable.

- n  | Unicode Character “n” (U+006E) | e.g. n100
- ñ  | Unicode Character “ñ” (U+00F1) | e.g. ñ100
- 𝑛  | Unicode Character “𝑛” (U+1D45B) | e.g. 𝑛100
- ⋂  | Unicode Character “⋂” (U+22c2) | e.g. ⋂100
- ∩  | Unicode Character “∩” (U+2229) | e.g. ∩100
