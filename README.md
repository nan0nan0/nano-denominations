## Smallest and Largest Units of Nano currency

Nano's smallest unit is 1 raw. The largest unit is 1Gnano. 

| 1 raw | | | | | | 1 unano | 1mnano | 1knano | 1 Mnano | 1 Gnano | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10<sup>0</sup> | 10<sup>3</sup> | 10<sup>6</sup>  | 10<sup>9</sup>  | 10<sup>12</sup> | 10<sup>15</sup> | 10<sup>18</sup> | 10<sup>21</sup>  | 10<sup>24</sup>  | 10<sup>27</sup> | 10<sup>30</sup>  | 10<sup>33</sup>  |



1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 raw (1033) = 1 Gnano

1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 raw (1030) = 1 Mnano = 1 XRB/NANO (exchange pair)

1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 raw (1027) = 1 knano

1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 raw (1024) = 1 nano

1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 raw (1021) = 1 mnano

1,000,000,000,000,000,000 raw (1018) = 1 μnano

1,000,000,000,000,000 raw (1015)

1,000,000,000,000 raw (1012)

1,000,000,000 raw (109)

1,000,000 raw (106)

1,000 raw (103)

1 raw


## Nano Denomination History

Initially Nano Currency was called Raiblocks,  The initial mint of and subsequent burn of Nano currency resulted in a distribution 133,248,297 individual units, known as coins. Becasue of the distribution, there can only be superunits that go up to one hundred million Nano, as there is not enough coin supply to reach any higher denomination. 

Nano has a very high resolution for a currrency, as it is precise to 10<sup>30</sup> decimal places, or one . Nano could contain up to thirty subunit terms to describe each decimal place. For brevity we have only included the first 10 subunits and the first 5 superunits.


## Precision	

Nano is precise to 10<sup>30</sup> decimal places.

### Nano Superunits	

1000	Gnano

### Nano Subunits	

| Unit Symbol | Unit Name  | Unit Description  | Unit decimal amount  | Unit Expression |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 kn | knano | One thousandth of a Nano  | 0.001  |  1 ⁄ 1,000 |
| 1 n | nano | One millionth of a Nano  | 0.0000001  |  1 ⁄ 1,000,000 |
| 1 mn | mnano | One billionth of a Nano  | 0.0000000001  |  1 ⁄ 10<sup>9</sup>	|
| 1 μn | μnano | One trillionth of a Nano  | 0.0000000000001  | 1 ⁄ 10<sup>12</sup>	|
| 1 raw | raw | One nonillionth of a Nano  | 0.0000000000000000000000000000001  |  1 ⁄ 10<sup>30</sup>	|

### Ideas for Nano Symbols

It has been mentioned that in absence of a Nano unicode charater, another symbol could be used as a sign to denote Nano. Here are a few signs that may be suitable.
