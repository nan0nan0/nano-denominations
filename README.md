## Nano Units

The initial mint of and subsequent burn of Nano currency resulted in a distribution 133,248,297 individual units, known as coins. Becasue of the distribution, there can only be superunits that go up to one hundred million Nano, as there is not enough coin supply to reach any higher denomination. 

Nano has a very high resolution for a currrency, as it is precise to 10<sup>30</sup> decimal places, or one . Nano could contain up to thirty subunit terms to describe each decimal place. For brevity we have only included the first 10 subunits and the first 5 superunits.

### Ideas for Nano Symbols

It has been mentioned that in absence of a Nano unicode charater, another symbol could be used as a sign to denote Nano. Here are a few signs that may be suitable.
